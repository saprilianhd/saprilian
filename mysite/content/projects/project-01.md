# Problem Understanding
This data science project focused on analyzing customer reviews of Emirates Airlines obtained from the https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/emirates/. By applying text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the sentiment of the reviews was categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. The findings revealed that the majority of the reviews (1407) were classified as positive, indicating a high level of satisfaction among Emirates Airlines' users. However, there were also negative reviews (620) and neutral reviews (214), suggesting areas for improvement in the airline's services. Overall, the analysis demonstrated the importance of understanding customer sentiment and provided valuable insights for Emirates Airlines to enhance the quality of their services based on customer feedback.

The project also examined frequently mentioned words, bigrams, and trigrams. "Flight" was the most common word, followed by "Emirates" and "Dubai," reflecting the association between flying experiences, the airline, and the destination. Significant bigrams included "via Dubai" and "business class," emphasizing Dubai as a transit hub and premium travel experience. Noteworthy trigrams were "via Dubai Emirates" and "business class seat," highlighting flying via Dubai, comfortable seating, and airline services. These findings inform Emirates Airlines' service and marketing strategies.
