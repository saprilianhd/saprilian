      <description>Problem Understanding This data science project focused on analyzing customer reviews of Emirates Airlines obtained from the https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/emirates/. By applying text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the sentiment of the reviews was categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. The findings revealed that the majority of the reviews (1407) were classified as positive, indicating a high level of satisfaction among Emirates Airlines&amp;rsquo; users. However, there were also negative reviews (620) and neutral reviews (214), suggesting areas for improvement in the airline&amp;rsquo;s services.</description>

      <description>Introduction So you probably have heard of the term Bioinformatics before, but did not get the chance to learn more about what it is and what it can do.
In this article, I will be giving you a brief high-level overview of this exciting field of Bioinformatics. Thus, the article will be comprehensible to those coming from biology or computer backgrounds alike.
As a biologist, I have self-taught myself data science and coding (R and Python) after several years of persistence (initially quitting a couple of times the coding concept just kind of clicked at some point in time).</description>
