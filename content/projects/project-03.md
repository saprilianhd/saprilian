# Problem Overview

Kyozo, a prominent global hotel chain, is seeking the assistance of a data consultant to develop a price prediction model for their upcoming hotel ventures. As the chosen data consultant, you have been provided with a dataset containing information from thousands of their current hotels. However, Kyozo's team lacks expertise in handling data, and thus, you are tasked with matching columns and values to various hotel examples for accurate predictions.

Unveiling the Fascinating Dataset Features. The dataset encompasses essential features of the hotels, including:

1. Facilities: This feature captures the wide array of amenities provided by the hotels, ranging from luxurious spas and swimming pools to state-of-the-art fitness centers and gourmet restaurants. Unleashing the potential of these facilities can greatly influence price predictions for Kyozo's new ventures.

2. Rating: The rating feature reflects the feedback and ratings bestowed upon the hotels by their esteemed visitors. By scrutinizing these ratings, you can unlock valuable insights into customer satisfaction levels and discern patterns that contribute to price variations.

3. Location: Location plays a pivotal role in the success of any hotel venture. This feature provides information about the city where each hotel is situated, enabling you to delve into the influence of location on pricing. Whether it's the bustling cityscape, scenic surroundings, or proximity to major attractions, location adds a unique dimension to the price prediction model.

Embark on this thrilling data consulting journey with Kyozo Hotels and leverage the power of data analysis to unlock invaluable insights. By accurately predicting prices based on facilities, ratings, and location, you can empower Kyozo to make informed decisions and excel in their new hotel developments.
